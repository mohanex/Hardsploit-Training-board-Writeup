# Hardsploit-Training-board-Writeup
This repo contains a writeup for the SERMA Hardsploit new training board


The disparity between the emerging threats and the current operational response capabilities in the realms of IoT, Hardware, and Embedded Software is notable. This discrepancy escalates the risk of attacks on the data processed in the Internet of Things environment, which includes private data, sensitive device management, industrial processes, healthcare products, and more</b>

Hardsploit is an innovative tool that combines software and electronic auditing capabilities. It's built on a flexible and programmable platform using an FPGA component, making it a comprehensive framework for security testing. This tool is specifically designed to conduct security assessments on the electronic communication interfaces of embedded devices.</b>

With Hardsploit Modules, hardware testers are empowered to intercept, replay, and transmit data across various types of electronic buses utilized by the target hardware. The extent of interaction that Hardsploit affords testers is contingent on the specific features of the electronic bus in question, such as JTAG, SPI, I2C, and parallel address & data buses on chips, among others.</b>
